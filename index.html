<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Osaid. I will soon begin my 4th year studying computer engineering at An-Najah University. I am from Salfit, specifically Al-Zawiya. I joined this course to improve my web programming skills.</p>
<p>I have completed courses in data structures with OOP, Java, databases, C, and C++. I know a little about JavaScript but have no experience with web development, which is why I took this course. I also saw topics that are particularly interesting for computer engineers.</p>
